# Doctor Scheduling Web App

This is a web application for managing doctor schedules and appointments.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### 1. Install Dependencies

Open a terminal in the project root directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the Backend Server

In the same terminal, run the following command to start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 3. Open the Frontend

Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can do this by double-clicking the file or by using a live server extension in your code editor.

Once you open the `index.html` file, the application will fetch data from the backend server and display it on the page.
